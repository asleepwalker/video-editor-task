1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,587
You're called to create a post-apocalyptic giraffe astronaut.

2
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:05,500
Generated.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,259
Genghis Khan playing a guitar solo, pixel art.

4
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:10,677
Generated.

5
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,513
A man holding a delicious apple...

6
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:16,933
What's with his hands?

7
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:22,313
Why can't AI art make hands?

8
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,400
It doesn't matter what AI art model you use.

9
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:28,028
If you have a man holding a delicious apple

10
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,280
his hands will look weird holding it.

11
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,656
Why is this so hard?

12
00:00:32,656 --> 00:00:33,950
Seems easy enough, right?

13
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,996
We've got this weird situation where AI art instantly make...

14
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:41,791
Abraham Lincoln dressed like glam David Bowie.

15
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:45,336
But struggles with a woman holding a cell phone.

16
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,381
This isn't just a weird glitch.

17
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,800
The struggle of AI art with hands

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,053
can actually teach you something bigger...

19
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,930
about how AI art works.

20
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:05,774
I mean, what is so hard about this?

21
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:12,489
I asked an artist who has taught thousands of people...

22
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:14,991
how to draw hands from imagination.

23
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,118
Before someone becomes

24
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,371
or starts training to be an artist.

25
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:21,664
Like officially training.

26
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,999
It's pattern recognition.

27
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,168
You just grow up seeing a whole bunch of hands...

28
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,962
and you start knowing what hands look like.

29
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:30,381
You learn how things look by living in the world

30
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,509
and recognizing patterns.

31
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:36,554
An AI is similar but has key differences.

32
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:39,057
Imagine an AI is like you...

33
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,476
but trapped in a museum from birth.

34
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:45,021
All the machine has to learn from are the pictures...

35
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,774
and the little placards on the side.

36
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:51,277
Apple: A red apple on a brown table.

37
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,405
That's like the images it sees from the web

38
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:56,407
and the descriptions that go with them.

39
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,453
It's similar to how you learn, but locked in that museum.

40
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:02,622
If you want to understand an apple

41
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,833
you can rotate it in your hand.

42
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,918
You can watch it whenever you want.

43
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,878
If AI wants to understand an apple

44
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:13,383
it has to find another picture of an apple in the museum.

45
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,886
Pattern recognition has allowed AI and people

46
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,680
to draw decent apples...

47
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,224
but the processes differ.

48
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:24,102
You start training to become an artist, and now you're like

49
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,688
okay, now I have to learn the rules.

50
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,816
And that's where it becomes very different from how AI is learning.

51
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,486
Artists, in order to draw something complicated

52
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:37,991
we tend to simplify things into basic forms.

53
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,034
And so when you look at a hand...

54
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:44,497
you pretty much have the big blocky part of the palm, right?

55
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,457
You have the front, you have the back

56
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:47,917
and then you have the thickness.

57
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,419
So you can pretty much just make that

58
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,172
into like a square with some thickness to it.

59
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,424
Then an artist can add all the style

60
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,802
and texture and detail they want.

61
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,387
AI works differently.

62
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,555
Look at this hand.

63
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,349
The shapes are bizarre, but the AI has done

64
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,102
a great job showing the light and texture here.

65
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:10,106
Remember, the AI knows how things look

66
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,316
but not how they work.

67
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,944
So these patterns in pixels are easy to understand.

68
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,238
It never learned, however

69
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:20,241
that fingers don't really bend like this.

70
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,035
It doesn't simplify the forms.

71
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,995
Remember, it's trapped in the museum

72
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:27,999
so it is just trying to guess where hand-like pixels should be.

73
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,002
Without knowing how hands work like we do.

74
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,422
But listen, I find this kind of dissatisfying.

75
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:37,175
I mean, I'm basically just saying that AI can't draw hands

76
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,551
because it's not a person.

77
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,721
But AI also doesn't know anything about construction

78
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,682
and it can still make a beautiful skyscraper

79
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,267
in New York City.

80
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,520
So to understand this better

81
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,064
I spoke to two people who have worked

82
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,690
with generative art models.

83
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,527
Yilun Du is a grad student whose heart is in robotics.

84
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:59,197
But, you know, AI art is like a big deal now.

85
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,823
So, he got pulled into it.

86
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,617
Because of how popular these models have been

87
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:03,660
in generative art....

88
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,828
I've also been working on that.

89
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,163
And I talked to Roy Shilkrot

90
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,957
who has a super varied resume

91
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:12,543
but has been teaching about generative art since 2018.

92
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,629
Good students that come in....

93
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,880
that are trying to break those models

94
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,923
take them to the next level.

95
00:04:17,923 --> 00:04:19,466
Talking to them helped me figure out

96
00:04:19,466 --> 00:04:20,676
three big reasons.

97
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,388
Not every reason, but three big reasons

98
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,432
that hands are tough for AI art models.

99
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,851
The data size and quality

100
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:32,605
the way hands act and the low margin for error.

101
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:36,526
For the data size, let's go back to the museum idea.

102
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,403
The museum the robot hangs out in

103
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,322
it has a ton of rooms dedicated to faces...

104
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,992
but not so many rooms for hands.

105
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,077
That means it has less to learn from.

106
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,121
Just as an example, available datasets

107
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,249
like Flickr HQ has 70,000 faces.

108
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,376
70,000.

109
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:57,922
And this popular one annotates 200,000 pics of celebrity faces...

110
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:02,176
for lots of details like eyeglasses or pointy noses.

111
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,263
There are a ton of great hand datasets

112
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,265
that can really understand hands

113
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,475
like this one with 11,000 hands.

114
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:14,856
But these may not have been used to train the AI that makes art.

115
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,942
That data scarcity combines with the quality

116
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,153
and complexity of the data.

117
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,322
Hands data in the art museum

118
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,824
isn't yet annotated to show how they work.

119
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,285
Like the celebrities pointy noses.

120
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,619
What they say is...

121
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:31,289
there is an image and there is a person in the image

122
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,374
and that person is holding an umbrella.

123
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,376
You don't give the machine a lot of clues

124
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,628
saying this is a person holding the umbrella.

125
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,798
The thumb is going from one side

126
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:43,843
of the handle and the fingers are curled...

127
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,596
and then thumb is covering the index finger

128
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,722
but not the other one.

129
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:52,810
All that is made worse because hands do lots of things

130
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,562
compared to, say... faces.

131
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,815
So there's a pretty common like portrait photo face.

132
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,400
There are a lot of these photos online

133
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,985
and the thing is everything is very well centered, right?

134
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,445
Like eyes are always around here.

135
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,197
Like there's always this order.

136
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,367
That's not true of hands which can do this

137
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,577
and this and this.

138
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,038
I swear I'm sober right now.

139
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,122
Stan mentioned this, too.

140
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,083
How many fingers do you see right now?

141
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,377
Like two or three.

142
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,503
Like it doesn't know there's five.

143
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,629
Because sometimes there's two

144
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,546
sometimes there's three

145
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,048
sometimes four, sometimes five.

146
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,759
You can see these problems with AI hands

147
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:28,054
but the jankiness is all over AI art.

148
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:29,347
Just look at horses.

149
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,808
You can also have like three legs, five legs, six legs.

150
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,477
The model does not learn to explain this because there's too much diversity

151
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,646
and it doesn't have as much bias as we do.

152
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,648
Okay. Did you hear that last part he said?

153
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,984
Good, because it's really important.

154
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,986
It doesn't have as much bias as we do.

155
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:47,782
We care a lot about hands and need them to be perfect.

156
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,284
There is a low margin for error.

157
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,538
But because the model doesn't understand hands

158
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:56,791
hasn't seen many and because hands act weird...

159
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:01,170
it makes pictures that are like hands it’s seen in the museum

160
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,256
but not an exact hand.

161
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,426
That's good enough for a ton of stuff, but not hands.

162
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,760
Here, let me give you some examples.

163
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,553
Come over here.

164
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:14,475
So I typed “make me a person with exactly five freckles”.

165
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,602
So this one's from Dall-E 2.

166
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,688
This one is from Stable Diffusion

167
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,565
and this one is from Midjourney.

168
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,483
So it's like, you know, great job.

169
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:25,570
You've got a red haired person.

170
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,196
They're more likely to have freckles.

171
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:30,116
But there are not exactly five freckles here.

172
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:34,328
Here that doesn't really matter because we see a freckly face.

173
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:37,331
But hands require higher standards.

174
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,709
Look at our apple-holding man again.

175
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,377
I made 3 other variations.

176
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:44,172
The hands are all weird, but don't look at them right now.

177
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:48,134
It changed the shirt stripes, the buttons, the apple style...

178
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,262
None of that matters because it's stripe-like

179
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:54,015
button-like and apple-like.

180
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,350
But hand-like isn't good enough.

181
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,812
I came away from this thinking a couple of things.

182
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,231
AI art is basically bad at art.

183
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,275
We're just able to see it with hands...

184
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,944
and B, it's never going to get any better.

185
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,071
But both of those things are a bit wrong.

186
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:12,158
I will say that the newest AI art generator to come out

187
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,286
at the time of this video is Midjourney version 5

188
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:18,164
and they made some progress with hands for sure...

189
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,667
but it's not totally fixed yet.

190
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,045
Don't tell the AI

191
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,087
to hold an umbrella.

192
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:31,177
I think they're spending lots of time

193
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,888
on some things that you appreciate, which is why you like the images

194
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,015
and a lot of stuff that you don't actually even notice.

195
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,351
I think that for a lot of natural scenery or something like that

196
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,436
I feel like model might be better at that than people.

197
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,938
And they are working on two things.

198
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,899
First, they have the AI look at a ton more pictures

199
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,943
which requires more computing power.

200
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,986
They're trying to solve that on a big scale

201
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,405
because if you want to train

202
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,866
on more than a handful of images...

203
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,452
if you want to train more than 100 images

204
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,412
this would take tremendous resources from you

205
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,289
to retrain the model itself.

206
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:03,459
The other solution might be to invite more people...

207
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,086
into the museum.

208
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,254
There's an interesting analog.

209
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,297
So like, have you heard of like ChatGPT?

210
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:11,592
The big difference was that it basically used human feedback.

211
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,511
So like they generated many, many sentences

212
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:16,222
and asked people to rate which ones are good and which ones are not good.

213
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,431
They basically fine tune the model

214
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,641
so that it would generate sentences

215
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,059
that are convincing to people.

216
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,727
I guess it would require a lot of engineering

217
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,896
to get people to label so much data.

218
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,190
But I think if we could just get like people to rank...

219
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,193
how good the images are generated by these models

220
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,571
then like a lot of these issues will go away, actually.

221
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:34,448
Because they're just training the models to do what people like.

222
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,245
It's not just the hand... teeth and abs.

223
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,746
Anything where there's like a pattern...

224
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,039
a large amount of something.

225
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:45,376
It doesn't know the rule of “there are this many”

226
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,461
because it's trained on different amounts.
